# tree-farm.lua
- Farms a 4x4 grid of 2x2 spruce trees (16 trees total)
- Produces around 5000 wood per hour
- The below image shows the farm from the perspective of the bottom left corner (note the chunk loader for the farm)
- That chest needs to be full of saplings
- The sides need are 4 blocks wide with 2 blocks between each dirt platform

- The below image shows the storage hopper exporter from Tom's Simple Storage exporting saplings from my system into the chest
- The bottom water stream just collects into a chest - you can sort as you like from there
